## Data Science algorithms and datasets (just for fun :)

- Some of these are examples belong to other data scientists and I have just simply adapted them to run in my computer. 
- Others belong to Internet well-known courses and resources
- I also adapted some examples from amazing books of Goodfellow-Bengio-Courville and Hastie-Tibshirani (et all)
